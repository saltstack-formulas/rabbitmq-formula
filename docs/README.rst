-------------------------

Commit messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Commit message formatting is significant!!**

Please see `How to contribute <https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_ for more details.

pre-commit
^^^^^^^^^^

`pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ is configured for this formula, which you may optionally use to ease the steps involved in submitting your changes.
First install  the ``pre-commit`` package manager using the appropriate `method <https://pre-commit.com/#installation>`_, then run ``bin/install-hooks`` and
now ``pre-commit`` will run automatically on each ``git commit``. ::

  $ bin/install-hooks
  pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
  pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/commit-msg

Special notes
-------------

The default node in any rabbitmq installation is 'rabbit@localhost'. Multiple nodes per host are allowed if defined in pillar data under `rabbitmq:nodes`.  Clustering is supported, see `pillar.example`.

Available states
----------------

.. contents::
   :local:

``rabbitmq``
^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Meta-state (This is a state that includes other states)*.

This installs the rabbitmq package,
manages the rabbitmq configuration file and then
starts the associated rabbitmq service.

``rabbitmq.package``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will install the rabbitmq package and has a dependency on ``rabbitmq.install``
via include list.

``rabbitmq.config``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will configure the rabbitmq service and has a dependency on ``rabbitmq.install``
via include list. It excludes ``rabbitmq.config.cluster`` state

``rabbitmq.service``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will start the rabbitmq service and has a dependency on ``rabbitmq.config``
via include list.

``rabbitmq.clean``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Meta-state (This is a state that includes other states)*.

this state will undo everything performed in the ``rabbitmq`` meta-state in reverse order, i.e.
stops the service,
removes the configuration file and
then uninstalls the package.

``rabbitmq.service.clean``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will stop the rabbitmq service and disable it at boot time.

``rabbitmq.config.clean``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will remove the configuration of the rabbitmq service and has a
dependency on ``rabbitmq.service.clean`` via include list.

``rabbitmq.package.clean``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This state will remove the rabbitmq package and has a depency on
``rabbitmq.config.clean`` via include list.

*Meta-state (This is a state that includes other states)*.

Testing
-------

Linux testing is done with ``kitchen-salt``.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Ruby
* Docker

.. code-block:: bash

   $ gem install bundler
   $ bundle install
   $ bin/kitchen test [platform]

Where ``[platform]`` is the platform name defined in ``kitchen.yml``,
e.g. ``debian-9-2019-2-py3``.

``bin/kitchen converge``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Creates the docker instance and runs the ``rabbitmq`` main state, ready for testing.

``bin/kitchen verify``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Runs the ``inspec`` tests on the actual instance.

``bin/kitchen destroy``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Removes the docker instance.

``bin/kitchen test``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Runs all of the stages above in one go: i.e. ``destroy`` + ``converge`` + ``verify`` + ``destroy``.

``bin/kitchen login``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Gives you SSH access to the instance for manual testing.
